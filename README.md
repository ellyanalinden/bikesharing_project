## Project description
In this project, I need to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset. The aim is to have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before moving toward higher level tools such as PyTorch.
The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.


## Result & Conclusion
Aim training_loss: 0.09 & validation_loss: 0.18
My hyperparameters: 
 <br />iterations = 50000
 <br />learning_rate = 0.1
 <br />hidden_nodes = 100
 <br /> output_nodes = 1
